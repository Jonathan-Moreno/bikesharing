# NYC CitiBike Analysis

## Project Overview

Use Tableau to create data visualizations that showcase the utilization of CitiBike in New York City during the month of August 2019, in hopes of spreading the platform to other major US cities

## Results

* Data showed a total of 2,344,224 trips being made via CitiBikes

* Of those 2,344,224 trips the majority were made by subscribers to the service (shown in orange on the pie chart above)

* Further Analysis of the usertypes revealed that Male users are the most popular subscribers to the service while Female and Unknown Gendered Users made up much less of the usage throughout weekdays

* The graph above shows the peak hours of usage being between 5:00PM and 6:00PM
* Lowest hours of usage and best times for bike maintenance would be between 3:00AM and 4:00AM

* This graph shows the average duration of trips for all users
* Graph shows that most rides tend to be fairly short, ranging between 5-10 minutes, while much less trips last longer than an hour

* This graph showcases the average duration of trips for all users broken down by gender
* Graph shows far greater usages my males once again

* The heat map above shows CitiBike usage for all users throughout the days of the week broken down by hour
* This visual shows that mornings and evenings are busier times throughout the weekdays while afternoon hours are busier during weekends
* ![Screen Shot 2022-05-21 at 9 10 32 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96406929/169678774-02abfba1-0661-4817-9340-a164f6e2bc6d.png)
* This last heat map shows a breakdown of gendered usage for all days of the week by hour
* This visual again shows far more utilization of CitiBikes by males

## Summary

The results of this data analysis show how a CitiBike program can generate a great deal of revanue for other major cities across the US. The data visualizations have also shown that male users are a more profitable audience than female for use of CitiBikes. The visualizations also display ideal hours for maintenance windows and which days and times of the week are the busiest. One additional visualization I would like to preform with this dataset is another bar chart showing how the age of each user affects their trip duration. I would also like to include a data visualization that shows if any CitiBikes were never returned after starting their trip to get a sense of theft.
